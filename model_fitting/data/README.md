## Adding Data

If you do not see the vaccine you are concerned with in "vaccines.csv", add it in! Make sure to push the .csv back to this folder so that others can use it as well.

No data needs to be added to the covid19dh.csv as it automatically updates each time the model parameters are called to be fit.

Test data in the form of .npy files can be found in the folder test_data in the previous directory. These files an be used for any testing if you want to avoid waiting for fitting.
